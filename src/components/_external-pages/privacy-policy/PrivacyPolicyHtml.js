          US has implemented legislation (Generally referred to as US Anti-Spam
          Legislation) prohibiting commercial electronic communications without
          adequate consent, and without an adequate unsubscribe mechanism.
          Commercial electronic communications (“CEMs”) are defined as emails
          and text messages. It is the policy of IRekommend to not send CEMs
          without valid legal consent from the recipient, and it is the policy
          of IRekommend to always use the unsubscribe mechanisms prescribed by
          US Anti Spam legislations.

          Please note that an individual’s ability to access his or her personal
          information under our control is not an absolute right. United States
          law provides that IRekommend must not disclose personal information
          where:
          <ul className="list-group">
            <li>
              The disclosure could reasonably be expected to threaten the safety
              or physical or mental health of an individual other than the
              individual who made the request;
            </li>
            <li>
              The disclosure would reveal personal information about another
              individual; or
            </li>
            <li>
              The disclosure would reveal the identity of an individual who has
              in confidence provided us with an opinion about another individual
              and the individual providing the opinion does not consent to the
              disclosure of his or her identity.

          Certain United States laws also provide that IRekommend may choose not

            <li>
              The disclosure of the information would reveal confidential
              commercial information and it is not unreasonable to withhold that
              information;
            </li>
            <li>
              The personal information was collected by IRekommend for an

            </li>
            <li>
              The disclosure of the personal information might result in similar
              information no longer being provided to us when it is reasonable
              that it would be provided;
            </li>
            <li>
              the personal information was collected or created by a mediator or

        REQUEST FOR CORRECTION

      <ul className="list-group">

          Certain laws permit individuals to submit written requests to us to
          correct errors or omissions in their personal information that is in
          our custody or control. If an individual alleges errors or omissions
          in the personal information in our custody or control, we will either:
          <ul className="list-group">
            <li>
              correct the personal information and, if reasonable to do so, and
              if not contrary to law, send correction notifications to any other

          Governing Law and No className Proceedings. The laws of the State of

          Carolina, will govern use ofthis Agreement and the interpretation,
          validity and effect of this Agreement, notwithstanding the parties’
          physical location (whether permanent or temporary),residence or
          domicile. The parties agree to not commence any action by way of

              Arbitration: The Parties agree that any and all disputes, claims
              or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement that
              are not resolved by their mutual agreement shall be submitted to
              final and binding arbitration before Arbitrator of the federal
              state or its successor, pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act of
              United States (FAA). Either Party may commence the arbitration
              process called for in this Agreement by filing a written demand
              for arbitration with ADR Chambers of United States, with a copy to
              the other Party. The arbitration will be conducted inaccordance
              with the provisions of ADR Chambers’ Arbitration Rules in effect
              at the time of filing of the demand for arbitration. The Parties
              will cooperate with ADR Chambers and with one another in selecting
              a single arbitrator from ADR Chambers’ panel of members, and in
              scheduling the arbitration proceedings. The Parties agree that
              they will participate in the arbitration in good faith. The
              provisions of this Section may be enforced by any Court of
              competent jurisdiction, and the Party seeking enforcement shall be
              entitled to an award of all costs, fees and expenses, including
              attorneys’ fees, to be paid by the party against whom enforcement
              is ordered. The place of arbitration shall be Toronto, Ontario.
            </li>
            <li>
              The arbitration shall proceed in accordance with the provisions of
              the Federal Arbitration Act of United States (FAA). The arbitrator
              shall have the power to proceed with the arbitration and to
              deliver their award notwithstanding the default by any party in
              respect of any procedural order made by the arbitrator. It is
              further agreed that such arbitration shall be a condition
              precedent to the commencement of any action at law. The decision
              arrived at by the arbitrator shall be final and binding and no
              appeal shall lie therefrom. Judgment upon the award rendered by
              the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.
            </li>
            <li>
              Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration
              uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow
              for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to
              very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same
              damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to
              arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating
              to any aspect of this Agreement, whether based in contract, tort,
              statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and
              regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the
              termination of this Agreement.
