Either Party may commence the arbitration\r\n              process called for in this Agreement by filing a written demand\r\n              for arbitration with ADR Chambers of United States, with a copy to\r\n              the other Party. The arbitration will be conducted inaccordance\r\n              with the provisions of ADR Chambers’ Arbitration Rules in effect\r\n              at the time of filing of the demand for arbitration.

It is\r\n              further agreed that such arbitration shall be a condition\r\n              precedent to the commencement of any action at law. The decision\r\n              arrived at by the arbitrator shall be final and binding and no\r\n              appeal shall lie therefrom.
